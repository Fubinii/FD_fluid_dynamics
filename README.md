# Lid-Driven Cavity Fluid Simulation with Finite Differences

This is the Github Repository for the final Assignment of Computational Physics. 
It contains the following:

1. **FD_fluid_dynamics.ipynb:** The Jupyter notebook containing all of the coding. It contains its own section about to how to run the code, please read that before executing any cell.
2. **/data:** A folder containg the simulation data. The data in there has been run with a relatively high grid size and can be loaded again for evaluation.
3. **/figure:** A folder for all of the figure that the code produces.
